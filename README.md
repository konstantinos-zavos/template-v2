# My template v2

I have learned about webpack so it's only natural to create a new template

Type "npm start" to open web server, which automatically has --watch enabled. 

## .gitignore

node_modules are ignored, use "npm install" to install them

## What's included

css loader, lodash, eslint+prettier, watch and web-dev-server, img loader
